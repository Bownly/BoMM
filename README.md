# BoMM

Welcome to the Binding of Megaman code. 
Ignore any ramblings in the comments, and also ignore the general lack of comments throught the entire rest of the code. Also, forgive the gross, universal inadherance to any particular style conventions. Chalk that up to being "my b".



# FlashDevelop tricks or tips and such

-F4 on a function or class will take you to that fn or class' declaration

-F5 will auto-compile and run

-Switch up top to debug mode rather than release in order to skip the splash screen

-I find building in neko to be fastest over windows, html5, or whatever

-Ctrl + Shift + 1 on a class name will auto import that class


# Style Guidelines
Style Guidelines

Function names:
Functions are to be ordered in two groups. For the first group, new() should always be first, followed by update(), kill(), finishKill(), and destroy(). (Note that not all classes will have a need for all of these functions.) Finally, any further overrides should follow in alphabetical order.
The second group of functions should be all the other functions for that class and should be alphabetized. Oh, and there should be an extra linebreak inbetween the two sets of functions. No other special rules atm.

Variable names:
Nothing concrete yet. Open for suggestions.
