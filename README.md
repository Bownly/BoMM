# BoMM

Welcome to the Binding of Megaman code. 
Ignore any ramblings in the comments, and also ignore the general lack of comments throught the entire rest of the code. Also, forgive the gross, universal inadherance to any particular style conventions. Chalk that up to being "my b".


Here's the deal so far:

-I have plans to completely overhaul the level stitching code, so maybe just avoid that for now.

-Similarly, I'm thinking of possibly overhauling Ladder.hx to mirror the implementation found in that platform jumper tutorial. Maybe. That would require 2 maps for every map, which might get excessive. We'll see, probably when I overhaul the level stitching code.

-I want to organize the levels folder and the source folder, but I've thusfar been too lazy to do so. 


That's it for now. Holler if you have any questions or comments or concerns or cornucopias.


Oh yeah, and Snaake.hx is actually that one enemy that goes back and forth and speeds up when you're on its same y level.


# FlashDevelop tricks or tips and such

-F4 on a function or class will take you to that fn or class' declaration

-F5 will auto-compile and run

-Switch up top to debug mode rather than release in order to skip the splash screen

-I find building in neko to be fastest over windows, html5, or whatever

-Ctrl + Shift + 1 on a class name will auto import that class
